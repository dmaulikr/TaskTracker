TaskTracker
===========

An app through which I learned Xcode, Swift, Cocoa, and RealmDB. I designed TaskTracker to be simple and easy to understand, while still containing enough data to be useful for a university student. I use it every day of my life.

Usage
=====

- Add tasks using the add button in the navigation bar.
- Mark tasks complete by tapping on their names.
- Delete tasks by swiping and tapping delete.
- Edit tasks by tapping on the information button.
- Titles and due dates are necessary, but topics are not.

Version History
===============

- 1.0
  - Tasks can be edited using the information button.
  - This will be streamlined in a future update.
  - Aplication icon badge now displays total number of unfinished tasks
