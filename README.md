TaskTracker
===========

An app through which I learned Xcode, Swift, Cocoa, and RealmDB. Used as my daily homework tracker.

Usage
=====

Add tasks using the add button in the navigation bar.
Mark tasks complete by tapping on their names.
Delete tasks by swiping and tapping delete.
Edit tasks by tapping on the information button.
Titles and due dates are necessary, but topics are not.
