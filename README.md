TaskTracker V1.1
===========

An app through which I learned Xcode, Swift, Cocoa, and RealmDB. I designed TaskTracker to be simple and easy to understand, while still containing enough data to be useful for a university student. I use it every day of my life.

- Add tasks using the add button in the navigation bar.
- Mark tasks complete by tapping on their names.
